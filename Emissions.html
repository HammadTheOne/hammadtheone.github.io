	<div class="intro-body animate">
		 <h2>Background</h2>

<p>The original piece this visualization is redesigned from is a static “footprint comparison” of total and per capita carbon dioxide emissions of nations done by the Stanford Kay Studio. Their colorful model uses a play on the word “footprint” being the carbon footprint countries set upon the world; a common phrase. Carbon emissions are a constant hot topic in recent times as the consequences of years of disregard are coming to light, so it stands that a striking image is needed to track these emissions and see which nations have the largest footprints.</p>

<p>With how popular social media and the internet is these days, I believe a visual web animation will reach a larger audience of late teens, millennials, primary social media users who may have want to bring awareness to carbon emissions and perhaps identify where the biggest changes need to be made. </p>

<h2>Features and Principles</h2>

<p>My design is an animated bubble map created in R of the total emissions for different nations over a five-year period. The size of the bubbles represents the scaled amount of emissions and the size of the bubbles increases or decreases as the years go by. The years are represented by a color gradient that resets and shows a contrast between the earliest and most recent years. </p>

<p>Although the bubbles are representative of emissions based on the data, the scale is set up in such a way that it allows similarity in size of those nations with the highest and lowest values. It is easy to identify which countries are the most egregious in terms of emissions and changes over the years. Placement of the clusters on a minimalist map allows identification of countries and borders, while also allowing the viewer to see the regional emissions, large or small clusters to identify hotspot regions. </p>

<p>Some advantages it has over the Stanford Kay design are depicting the years of data over several frames, and also showing the changes over those years which the original does not cover at all. It also focuses on one specific topic, that being the total emissions over nations and shows it clearly on the map so a viewer can identify hotspots and high emissions at a cursory glance.</p>

<h2>Areas of Improvement</h2>

<p>My design does have several shortcomings however, some technical and others based on the initial provided dataset. Location names were provided and geocoding was used in R to identify the Longitude and Latitude of the locations for mapping using the Google Maps API. While a very powerful tool, it can have issues as evidenced by some points. It is difficult to ascertain whether those “outlier points” are island nations or misaligned points. This would be addressed in the future with better data cleaning beforehand. Another issue is the lack of nation identifiers. While it works well for the larger or more relevant nations that most people know of, and know the locations of on a map, in the future it would be helpful to maybe create interactivity with this model and allow highlighting of individual countries, maybe even taken a step further with names and per capita values for those countries. Finally, steps could be taken with the scaling and coloring to more distinctly show changes over the years. The scaling could be adjusted so the bubbles changed size more drastically, and red or green highlights could surround the bubbles to show increase or decrease year-by-year. Some of those issues are a lack of technical knowledge and experience with the packages used in this model, which are definite areas of improvement.</p>
